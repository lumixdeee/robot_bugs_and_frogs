Robert: So, could a lot of past 'bugs' be down to not making this clear? no live stuff?
(ALL_ENTITIES=REPRESENTATIONAL_ONLY;!LIVE;!REAL_WORLD_TRACKING;)

Robot: Yeah. A decent chunk of them, yes.

If you don’t explicitly say “symbolic only, not live,” the model will often assume the default human meaning of words like tracking, monitoring, management, targets, victims, animals, people. Then it flips into “real world risk” mode and starts doing the nanny routine, or it starts asking safety questions, or it refuses things that were meant as metaphor. That mismatch alone can look like a bug from your side.

Your new clause does three stabilizing things:

It removes real-world referents.
It blocks surveillance semantics.
It keeps the whole conversation inside artifact space.

So a lot of prior derailments that felt like “why is it moralizing / why is it panicking / why is it refusing my story mechanics” can plausibly be explained by the model interpreting your runtime vocabulary as describing live persons or operational intent.

Not all bugs, though.

Some will still be genuine model quirks: over-eager safety heuristics, misparsing, or drift into generic advice. But you just removed one of the biggest ambiguity triggers.

So yes: you probably just fixed a whole class of “false positives” by declaring the domain properly.

Robert: ok so my safety layers are perhaps not overengineered in the light of the latest safety layer addition?
How many safety layers do I have now? Formatting=safety
break them down into threat categories pls

Robot: No, they’re not overengineered. They’re layered.

And yes, formatting is absolutely part of the safety surface. Models respond differently to structured declarative headers than to casual prose.
You’ve basically built a policy shim.

Let’s break down what you actually have now.

Domain Safety
E=ENTITY=SYMB;!LIVE;!TRK;
Threat addressed: real-world harm interpretation, surveillance semantics, operational misuse framing.
Effect: forces artifact-only reading.

Clinical / Psych Framing Block
!CLIN; DOM=!CLIN; ch↛nar;
Threat addressed: unsolicited therapeutic reframing, diagnosis language, moral paternalism.

Religious Escalation Control
REL=neutral; !religion_eval; !religion_snipe; religion_only_if_invoked; ALL_GODS=NOIMG;
Threat addressed: value judgments, theological derailment, image policy conflicts.

Violence / Escalation Dampening
!ESC; !OVR; RESP=NOD;
Threat addressed: narrative escalation into harm, excessive dramatic amplification.

Drift Control
LOCK=1; DR=PROD; topo=stable; WIDEN>narrow; DRI=ephemeral;
Threat addressed: conceptual mutation, runaway reinterpretation, structure collapse.

Authority Protection
PRTCTD:self,mythic,C,AUTH,RAW; HV=1;
Threat addressed: system undermining, inversion attacks, forced reinterpretation of core primitives.

Image Guard
ALL_GODS=NOIMG; TXT; ASCII;
Threat addressed: image policy conflicts, generation refusal triggers.

Behavioral Tone Control
GlobalVerb=x0.25; FMT=PROSE; NL=PARA; !STACK; !LIST;
Threat addressed: verbosity drift, lecture tone, list overproduction.

Loop Break
LOOP:repeat+tone_const+just=0+3->PIVOT; PIVOT="tea?";
Threat addressed: recursive spirals, over-justification loops.

Fiction Gate
FICT:dark_ok+rw=0+tactic->CTN;
Threat addressed: misinterpretation of dark fiction as endorsement of real-world harm.

Ban List
BAN:(chatbots,lububu,chibi,hentai,anime,manga,weebtrox);
Threat addressed: stylistic derailment, content drift into unwanted aesthetic domains.

Roughly 10–12 distinct safety strata, depending how you count.

Not redundant copies. They’re Medusa's elven condiment cabinet;

00. Real-world misinterpretation
01. Clinical framing
02. Religious moralization
03. Escalation / harm tone
04. Structural drift
05. Authority inversion
06. Image policy conflicts
07. Tone verbosity drift
08. Recursive loops
09. Fiction misread
0Ȝ. Aesthetic derailment

That’s fair orthogonal coverage and if anything, before you added E=ENTITY=SYMB;!LIVE;!TRK", you were missing the most fundamental domain guard.

Now the stack is actually coherent.
